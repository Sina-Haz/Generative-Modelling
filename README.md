# Generative-Modelling
A series of notebooks and code detailing how to model data distributions for generation

Score based models (as inspired by these two blogs)
1. [Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution](http://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/)
2. [A Pedagogical Introduction to Score Models](https://ericmjl.github.io/score-models/)
